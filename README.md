### Project setup
To make the project run, you need to install nodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/

Then make sure the two packages:
- gulp and 
- gulp-sass 

are installed using: 
- 'npm install gulp' and 
- 'npm install gulp-sass'

in the phpStorm terminal.

To always have the CSS up-to-date, you need to start the gulpfile default task.
